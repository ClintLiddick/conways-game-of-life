Introduction
------------
A simple Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life for a standard terminal. I
plan to make this package more flexible for exploring CGOL as I am able.

Running
-------
java Conway.Life
java Conway.Life <# of random cells>
java Conway.Life <# rand cells> <# of generations>

The most interesting simulations (for now) come from using approximately 150
cells over 100 generations.
